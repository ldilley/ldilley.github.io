This is my first post using [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
I originally used [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) casually in 2014. In the spring of 2020, I stopped using Blogger and archived
several of my [technical writeups](https://github.com/ldilley/techdocs). I plan to port the information contained in these documents to pages on this site.
I also intend to create posts for reference consisting of commands with various options and configurations.
