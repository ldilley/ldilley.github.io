<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Welcome to the second installment of the 64-bit Linux assembly tutorial. If you have not yet read part one of this tutorial, you can do so
<a href="linux_x64_assembly_part1.html">here</a>. If you have read it, I hope that you enjoyed it. We will be covering networking, debugging, optimizing, endianness, and analogous C code
in this tutorial. Let us get to it!</p><br>

<h4>The C Way</h4>
<p>We are going to start by looking at how you create a network program in C. See <a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/">Beej’s Guide to Network Programming</a> for more information.
I am illustrating socket programming in a higher-level language to give you a better idea of the sequence of events that occur. In order to accept network connections in a C program
(or assembly), you must take the following steps:</p><br>
<ol>
<li>Call <span class="literal">socket()</span> to obtain a file descriptor to be used for communication. We used file descriptors in the first tutorial
(<span class="literal">stdin</span>/<span class="literal">0</span> and <span class="literal">stdout</span>/<span class="literal">1</span> specifically.)</li>
<li>Call <span class="literal">bind()</span> to associate (or bind) the IP address of a network interface with the file descriptor returned by <span class="literal">socket()</span>.</li>
<li>Call <span class="literal">listen()</span> to make the file descriptor be receptive to incoming network connections.</li>
<li>Call <span class="literal">accept()</span> to handle incoming network connections.</li>
</ol><br>
<p><span class="literal">accept()</span> returns a file descriptor for the client which you can use to send and receive data to and from the remote end. You can also call
<span class="literal">close()</span> on the client file descriptor once you are done receiving or transmitting data. After putting it all together, it would look something like:</p><br>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;        /* for printf() and puts() */
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;       /* for exit() and perror() */
#include &lt;string.h&gt;       /* for strlen() */
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;   /* for AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, and socket_t */
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;   /* for INADDR_ANY and sockaddr_in */

#define PORT 9990         /* TCP port number to accept connections on */
#define BACKLOG 10        /* connection queue limit */

int main()
{
  /* server and connecting client file descriptors */
  int server_fd, client_fd;

  /* size of sockaddr_in structure */
  int addrlen;

  /* includes information for the server socket */
  struct sockaddr_in server_address;

  /* message we send to connecting clients */
  char* message = "Greetings!\n";

  /* socket() - returns a file descriptor we can use for our server
   * or -1 if there was a problem
   * Arguments:
   * AF_INET = address family Internet (for Internet addressing)
   * SOCK_STREAM = TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
   * 0 = default protocol for this type of socket
   */
  server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

  /* Check for an error */
  if(server_fd == -1)
  {
    perror("Unable to obtain a file descriptor for the server");
    exit(1);
  }

  server_address.sin_family = AF_INET;

  /* set the listen address to any/all available */
  server_address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;

  /* The htons() function below deals with endian conversion which
   * we'll discuss later. This assignment sets the port number to
   * accept connections on. */
  server_address.sin_port = htons(PORT);

  /* bind() - binds the IP address to the server's file descriptor or
   * returns -1 if there was a problem */
  if(bind(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&server_address,
          sizeof(server_address)) == -1)
  {
    perror("Unable to bind");
    exit(1);
  }

  /* listen() - listen for incoming connections */
  if(listen(server_fd, BACKLOG) == -1)
  {
    puts("Failed to listen on server socket!");
    exit(1);
  }

  addrlen = sizeof(server_address);

  puts("Waiting for connections...");

  /* Infinite loop to accept connections forever */
  for(;;)
  {
    /* accept() - handle new client connections */
    client_fd = accept(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&server_address,
                       (socklen_t*)&addrlen);
    if(client_fd == -1)
    {
      perror("Unable to accept client connection");
      continue;
    }
    /* Send greeting to client and then disconnect them */
    send(client_fd, message, strlen(message), 0);
    close(client_fd);
  }

  return 0;
}</code></pre><br>
<p>You should be able to copy and paste the above code into a text file. Compile it with: <span class="literal">gcc &lt;file&gt;.c -o network_example</span><br><br>
After compiling the program, execute it with: <span class="literal">./network_example</span><br><br>
If all went well, you should see something similar to below:</p><br>
<pre><code class="language-shell">[lloyd@lindev ~]$ ./network_example
Waiting for connections...</code></pre><br>
<p>Open another terminal and issue: <span class="literal">telnet localhost 9990</span><br><br>
You should see something like the following:</p><br>
<pre><code class="language-shell">[lloyd@lindev ~]$ telnet localhost 9990
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Greetings!
Connection closed by foreign host.</code></pre><br>
<p>You can read more about <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/bind">bind()</a>, <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/listen">listen()</a>, and <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/accept">accept()</a>
if you’re interested. Next up, we’re going to replicate the above C program in x86-64 assembly. Let’s see how it looks…</p><br>

<p>Thank goodness for high-level languages, eh? You can assemble and link just like you did from the first tutorial:<br>
<span class="literal">nasm -f elf64 -o network_example.o network_example.asm && ld -o network_example network_example.o</span><br><br>

You can then execute the program and test it with telnet the same way you did with the C version. The functionality should be very similar.</p><br>
<h4>Dissecting the Beast</h4>
<p>NASM allows programmers to use structs, so we take advantage of this for better data organization. Just like in the C program, a <span class="literal">sockaddr_in</span> structure is defined.
This is essentially a template which holds various data members. For review, the <span class="literal">BSS</span> section contains memory set aside for variable data during runtime. This makes sense
considering it is not known what our connecting client source addresses and ports will be. And since we know what address and port to use on the server side, the information can be set in the
<span class="literal">data</span> section as literals. I also touched on data types some in the first tutorial. The table below contains the types used in this program along with their sizes and
examples.</p><br>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Size</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="literal">resb</span>/<span class="literal">db</span></td>
<td>1 byte (8 bits)</td>
<td>A keyboard character such as the letter ‘c’</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="literal">resw</span>/<span class="literal">dw</span></td>
<td>2 bytes (16 bits) – also called a “word”</td>
<td>A network port with a maximum value of 65,535</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="literal">resd</span>/<span class="literal">dd</span></td>
<td>4 bytes (32 bits) – also called a “double word”</td>
<td>An IPv4 address such as 192.168.1.1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="literal">resq</span>/<span class="literal">dq</span></td>
<td>8 bytes (64 bits) – also called a “quad word”</td>
<td>A “long long” in C/C++ or represents a decimal number (float)</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>An “octa word” (128 bits) is also worth mentioning, but is not used in this program. These are used for scientific calculations, graphics, IPv6 addresses, globally unique IDs (GUIDs), etc. The dX
variety are initialized and the ‘d’ stands for “data”. So, <span class="literal">db</span> is “data byte” and <span class="literal">dw</span> is “data word”. The resX assortment is used for reserving
space for uninitialized data. <span class="literal">resb</span> would be “reserve byte” and <span class="literal">resq</span> is “reserve quad” for example. The “at” macro gets at each field and sets
it with the specified data. <span class="literal">struc</span> and <span class="literal">endstruc</span> define a structure. <span class="literal">istruc</span> and <span class="literal">iend</span>
declare an instance of a structure. You can see in the code how to refer to an instance by using a label (peeraddr for example.)<br><br>
In the <span class="literal">text</span> section (code), you should be able to get an idea of what is going on with the comments. The format is the same as the program from the first tutorial. It is
all a matter of putting bullets (data) in certain positions (registers) of a revolver and then pulling the trigger with <span class="literal">syscall</span>. That is an analogy I like to use anyway.
Again, you can refer to <a href="http://blog.rchapman.org/post/36801038863/linux-system-call-table-for-x86-64">Ryan A. Chapman’s 64-bit Linux system call table</a> for reference.
<span class="literal">sys_bind</span>, <span class="literal">sys_listen</span>, <span class="literal">sys_accept</span>, and other calls are all present there.</p><br>
<h4>Ten Little Endians</h4>
<p>Endianness (name originates from Gulliver’s Travels) refers to the way data is arranged in memory in the context of hardware architectures. I bring this up because we needed to call
<span class="literal">htons()</span> (short data from host to network order) in our C program on the network port. We also needed to convert the loopback IP address and TCP port number to network byte
order in the assembly program.<br><br>
x86/x86-64 are considered little-endian architectures whereas SPARC is big endian. Some processors, such as PPC, can handle both modes and are referred to as bi-endian. What does this mean exactly?
Well, on little-endian machines, the most-significant byte (MSB) is stored at the highest memory address. The least-significant byte (LSB) is stored at the lowest address. Big endian is the reverse
of this. An example would be storing three bytes that make up the word “BEEF”. Using the ASCII values for each letter in hexadecimal: ‘B’ is 0x42, ‘E’ is 0x45, and ‘F’ is 0x46. On a big-endian system,
the arrangement of bytes would appear as: 42 45 45 46. However, on a little-endian system, they would appear as: 46 45 45 42. Obviously, debugging is easier on a big-endian system since data is still
easily readable by humans. Meanwhile, little endian has the advantage of programmers being able to determine if a number is even or odd by looking at its LSB.<br><br>
Due to these differences, the need for a common format for data being transmitted over a network was clear. Big endian or network byte order was decided on for this purpose. How can we convert?
The easiest method is to use a calculator in programmer mode. Windows calculator supports this mode. The TCP port number 9990 in decimal is 2706 in hex. Since 0x27 is the most significant part, it
goes in the right-most slot. 0x06 goes on the left resulting in 0x0627. This is similar for the IP address. Each octet of 127.0.0.1 must be converted to hex. This yields 7F 00 00 01. Again, 127 or
0x7F is the most significant part, so it goes on the far right (lowest memory address.) You end up with 0x0100007F.</p><br>
<h4>A Closer Look</h4>
<p>You can use <span class="literal">gdb</span> or <span class="literal">valgrind</span> to debug of course, but this section is more about tracing program execution to demonstrate what is going on
from an OS perspective with system calls. If you have <span class="literal">strace</span> installed, issue:<br> <span class="literal">strace -f ./network_example</span><br><br>
You can actually see each system call from the assembly program and what arguments populate each function such as source port for peer address. Try connecting with <span class="literal">telnet</span>
with the trace still running and you can see <span class="literal">write()</span> and <span class="literal">close()</span> being called. Have a look:</p><br>
<pre><code class="language-shell">[lloyd@lindev ~]$ strace -f ./network_example
execve("./network_example", ["./network_example"], [/* 26 vars */]) = 0
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 3
bind(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(9990), sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, 16) = 0
listen(3, 10)                           = 0
write(1, "Waiting for connections...\n", 27Waiting for connections...
) = 27
accept(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(47944), sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, [16]) = 4
write(4, "Greetings!\n", 11)            = 11
close(4)                                = 0
accept(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(47946), sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, [16]) = 4
write(4, "Greetings!\n", 11)            = 11
close(4)                                = 0
accept(3, ^CProcess 27238 detached</code></pre><br>
<p>You can see from above that the server is assigned a file descriptor of 3 and the client is 4. 11 is the length of the greeting sent to the client. <span class="literal">sin_port</span> and
<span class="literal">sin_addr</span> from <span class="literal">accept()</span> contain the connecting client’s source IP address and port. Pretty slick, huh?</p><br>
<h4>Compacting A Compact Program</h4>
<p>As you can see, the size difference between the assembly program and the C program is significant. The functionally-equivalent C program is over 4 times as large:</p><br>
<pre><code class="language-shell">[lloyd@lindev ~]$ ls -lah network_example_*
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 lloyd linux_users 2.1K Dec 10 03:51 network_example_asm
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 lloyd linux_users 8.9K Dec 10 04:06 network_example_c</code></pre><br>
<p>Let’s see if we can squeeze both of these binaries a bit more…</p><br>
<pre><code class="language-shell">[lloyd@lindev ~]$ strip -s network_example_*
[lloyd@lindev ~]$ ls -lah network_example_*
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 lloyd linux_users  888 Dec 10 04:28 network_example_asm
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 lloyd linux_users 6.2K Dec 10 04:28 network_example_c</code></pre><br>
<p>Even after shaving off symbols from both binaries, the C program is now over 6 times larger than the assembly program. The assembly program isn’t even 1K. This is a testament to assembly’s
efficiency. Yay for assembly!</p><br>
<h4>Sayonara</h4>
