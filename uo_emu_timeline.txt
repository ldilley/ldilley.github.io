General UO Emulator Timeline

----------------------------

(Go here for an html-version of the Timeline: https://www.uox3.org/history/timeline.shtml )



Here follows a quick timeline of UO emulators, based on facts, fiction and wild guesses, numbered

from first to last. I've included any dates I've been able to dig up, as well as the current (when I checked)

homepages that exist for the various emus. Feel free to point out any flaws by contacting me at xuri@uox3.org.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



1997

1.) Jaegermeister (Denny Zuko?) creates the first version of UOX (Ultima Offline eXperiment)

2.) Cironian creates UOX2, rewriting UOX from scratch

3.) Fallo creates FUSE, a server expandable by user-made DLL-addons, such as CFuse, Thayland's DLL, and FuseX.

4.) Cironian redoes UOX2, and the first public UOX3 version (0.37) is released Oct 22. 1997.

?.) UOR - Ultima Online Revisited. Mentioned by Cironian at the time as the only other UO server emulator around.



1998/99

5.) A bunch of other UO servers that never really took off generally come to a halt when Cironian releases source for UOX3, including; New World Order, UOAWE(http://uoawe.vnet.net/wwwboard/ - started Feb 9. by Gabriel), and An unnamed UO Server(http://www.andreasen.org/uo/) by Erwin S. Andreasen.

6.) Menace creates Grayworld early in 1998. It eventually evolves into TUS (The Ultimate Server), which again evolves into Sphere (aka Sphereserver, http://www.sphereserver.com) around April 2000. A fork (SphereServer X) has been maintained alongside the main branch since 2016.

7.) Sheppard creates UOOS - the first object oriented UO emu, or something.

8.) Eric N. Swanson, aka Syzygy, creates POL (http://www.polserver.com) in the summer of 1998.

9.) What was later to become Hybrid was started sometime in 1998, around the time when the source for FUSE was released, and back then it went under the name Trespasser. Later it changed name to Hellfire, before being renamed as Hybrid.

10.) Armageddon makes his own version of UOX3, named AUOX,  causing the first "branching" of any UO emu to occur :P

    Some other people start working on another branch of UOX3, which they call "UOXGold".

11.) SpaceDog continues Armageddon's AUOX through "AUOXCon"(tinued)



2000

12.) Lord Binary does his own version of UOX3, called UOX-pi (http://stud1.tuwien.ac.at/~e9425109/uox3_1.htm) - later to be merged into Wolfpack.

13.) Ripper's customized UOX3 code grows into Wolfpack (http://www.wpdev.org/), while Chaos's customizations become Legions of Chaos

14.) Sunshine (http://www.sf.net/projects/sushix), a derivate work of an early Wolfpack version, is started by M. Strobl sometime in 2000. In 2003, version 3 of Sunshine is reforked from Wolfpack, because of memory restraints/unreadable codebase in the original fork. The successor of Sunshine, Sushix, is never officially released.



2001

15.) Epsilon is started by Kair in May 2001

16.) NOX-Wizard is created by xan using Wolfpack as base (25. June 2001)

17.) Wolfpack development splits in two as some WP devs pack up and start Lonewolf (https://lw.uox3.org/) on November 9th, 2001.

18.) The Shard Emulator, a Wolfpack v12.6 based emu, is started at the same time as Lonewolf.

19.) As the main UOX3 codebase drops the trigger-system and goes to a javascripting engine (https://www.uox3.org), spearheaded by Matthew Randall (EviLDeD) and Daniel Stratton (Abaddon), Sargo decides to continue the trigger-based UOX3-source under the fitting "UOX Classic" (http://www.uoxclassic.com) name, on Nov. 17, 2001.



2002

20.) UO-Inside Out, a Lonewolf derivate started by Skyfire?, releases it's first version in early January.

21.) Method (http://www.necrotic.net/method/), a project derived from Lonewolf, is started by Melchir in early February 2002.

22.) Atum, a russian developed UO Emu, has it's first release in February 2002. It's closed source, and has no released packages.

23.) Version 0.1 of Tupi (http://www.sf.net/projects/tupi), a server written in Java, is released on the 4th of February 2002 by speka/dalzhim.

24.) Middle-Earth Custom UOX (https://sourceforge.net/projects/middlearthuox/), a fork of UOX3 by Sargo, sees its first release on February 11th, 2002.

25.) Revelation (http://www.sf.net/projects/revelationemu), based on NOX-Wizard, enters the scene, on Aug 21st, 2002.

26.) Krrios reveals RunUO (http://www.runuo.com) in early september 2002 - the first UO emu written in C#. Official development ended in August 2014, after nearly 12 years.

27.) Shadowlord starts working on SteamEngine (http://steamengine.ultima.cz/), an open-source UO emu mimicing Sphereserver's functionality, on Sept. 29th, 2002.



2003

28.) punt starts up UOX3 "Unofficial" (http://uoxe.sourceforge.net/) on the first day of 2003, intending to rewrite the "JS"UOX3-version.

29.) UOX:NG - derivate work of UOX-Classic, started with big-endian 64 bit machines in mind, by Generic Player

30.) MyUO (http://myuo.sourceforge.net/) is created by Fabrizio Montesi, in October 2003.

31.) Hypnos: UO Server Emulator (https://github.com/Flameeyes/hypnos), a fork of NOX-Wizard by Diego Elio Petten√≤ (Flameeyes), has its first CVS commit on 28th of December, 2003. Goals: To combine the power of UOX and the ease-of-use of Sphere, with a dynamically loaded, python-based scripting engine.

32.) Psychotropic - A successor project to Hybrid, is started in December 2003 by Ian McNealy



2004

33.) The initial revision of the source for AUOE (Advanced Ultima Online Emulator - https://sourceforge.net/projects/auoe/) is submitted to SourceForge on the 2nd of March, 2004, by f0xfire

37.) Initial version of RunUO-RE (Russian Edition - http://www.ruosi.org) is released to the public on New Year's Eve in 2004 by Wyatt, as a fork based off of 3rd party decompiled sources for the then closed-source RunUO, though it was later migrated over to the open-source version of RunUO. Eventually, from version 1.5.0 (with UO:SA support), it was renamed to RUOSI. Supports enhanced client and all expansions.



2005

38.) Max Kellermann forks SunUO (http://www.sunuo.org) from RunUO on February 5th, 2005. It runs on Mono 1.1 (Linux, FreeBSD) out of the box.
